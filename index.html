            </h2>
            <p>Starting in 2020, in the midst of a normal pre-pandemic world, I was a curious teenager with a high level of boredom. Out of curiosity, I decided to learn the basics of programming on my own, as well as delve into the field of pentesting and hacking.</p>
            <p>My skills in programming include understanding basic programming languages, which allows me to develop simple applications and understand the logic behind the code. In addition, I have also honed my skills in cybersecurity, focusing on penetration testing techniques that help identify and fix vulnerabilities in systems.</p>
            <p>Through intensive learning and exploration of various online resources, I have built a strong foundation in the world of information technology. I am committed to continuously developing my skills and applying the knowledge I have gained to contribute to creating secure and innovative solutions in the field of cybersecurity.</p>

            <p>Amidst the noise of the world, I am a time wizard who enjoys quiet moments.

In silence, I find strength and inspiration, as if the world is an adventure stage waiting to be explored. This is my greatest hobby: Enjoying the beauty in silence!</p>
